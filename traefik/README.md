## About
### This was forked and updated from an inactive github project [here](https://alxx.nl/home-assistant-addons/) -  
99% of the work on this was done by [alex3305](https://github.com/alex3305), i have simply updated the code to deploy the latest Traefik release and added some additional bits here and there.  

Traefik is a modern HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer that makes deploying microservices easy. This add-on provides dynamic Traefik configuration based on files.  

[Click here for the full Traefik documentation](https://docs.traefik.io/)  

## Configuration
During configuration, make sure you are adding `CF_DNS_API_TOKEN` and your Cloudflare API Token as an `env_var`, if you are using Cloudflare for your ACME cert verifications.  

## Known issues and limitations

* Default port 80 can conflict with other ports  
* Log level of 'warning/warn' does not work at this time, other log levels are fine - Default is 'error'.  
~~* Sidebar for Traefik does not render correctly - accessing via port (http://IP:8080/dashboard) is the current workaround.~~
